Casual step-by-step board game for mobile phones.

There are boards with several dots, connected with lines in the game. Every dot can have up to 6 units on it and can be controlled by player or his enemy. You can move units between dots per every turn. Units might be one of three types, which are uniquely vulnerable to each other.
Multiplayer mode works only with Photon Networking.
